#A Comment ,this is so you can rean your program later
#Angthing after the # is ignored by python
print("I could have code like this")# and the comment after is ignored
#You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
#print("This won't run")

print('This will run')

#检查代码的时候从最后一行倒着检查，这样可以减少思维定势
